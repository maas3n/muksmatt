> **muKsMaTT development:** The Unified release workflow is disabled while the fork is rebranded and a separate Android signing identity is established. No muKsMaTT stable or Play Store release has been published. Do not enable or dispatch production publishing without explicit authorization. The signing environment names and `MATTRIP_*` Gradle parameters are temporary inherited internal compatibility contracts; do not reuse MattRip's private keys.

# Releasing muKsMaTT

muKsMaTT uses one long-lived source branch, `main`, and one product version namespace across Windows, Linux, and Android/ChromeOS.

## Unified release model

Every new public release uses exactly one product tag and one GitHub Release:

- stable: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- preview: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, or `-rc.N`

Do not create new platform-specific version tags such as `-linux`, `-chromeos`, `-windows`, or separate `devN` release lines. Historical platform-specific tags remain valid historical pointers and are not rewritten.

A unified release contains the platform assets that are ready from the same tagged commit. Typical assets are:

- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Windows-Setup.exe`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Windows-All-in-One.exe`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Windows-Portable.zip`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Linux-amd64.deb`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Linux-amd64.tar.gz`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Linux-amd64Standalone`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Source.tar.gz`
- `muKsMaTT-<version>-Android.apk` — universal APK for Android phones/tablets and Chromebooks with Android app support
- third-party source/provenance/license files
- per-platform checksum manifests
- one combined `SHA256SUMS.txt`

`muKsMaTT-<version>-Android.apk` is the single persistently signed universal APK for both Android phones/tablets and Chromebooks with Android app support.

GitHub also exposes source ZIP/tar archives automatically for the release tag.

## Release principles

1. **Published release tags are immutable.** Never force-move an existing version tag.
2. **Published release assets are immutable.** Fix a released problem in a new version.
3. **All platform payloads come from the same tag/commit.** Windows, Linux, and Android/ChromeOS must not publish different source commits under the same product version.
4. **One tag creates one GitHub Release.** Platform workflows may build independently, but `.github/workflows/release.yml` is the only workflow that publishes GitHub Releases.
5. Generate and verify SHA-256 checksums for release payloads and verify bundled runtime dependencies before publishing.
6. Keep historical development provenance in Git history; obsolete platform-specific public release entries may remain retired after the unified-release cleanup.

## Before tagging

- Merge the intended source into `main`.
- Confirm Windows, Linux, and Android/ChromeOS CI is green.
- For releases containing Android, confirm **Android signing self-test** is green and both pinned signing fingerprints match the intended identities.
- Confirm pinned third-party versions/checksums and licensing/provenance documentation are current.
- Choose a muKsMaTT version/tag that is unused in this fork. Existing MattRip or MattMux tags belong to upstream provenance and must not be reused for muKsMaTT releases.
- Decide whether the release is stable or a shared preview.
- Do not reuse a tag that already exists or already has a GitHub Release.

## Publishing

Create the tag from the exact `main` commit to publish and push it:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

For a preview:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z-alpha.1
git push origin vX.Y.Z-alpha.1
```

The **Unified release** workflow then:

1. validates the unified tag format;
2. derives one product version plus the Android `versionCode`;
3. builds the Windows payload;
4. builds the Linux payload;
5. builds one signed universal `muKsMaTT-<version>-Android.apk` for both Android and ChromeOS;
6. verifies each platform payload;
7. downloads all platform artifacts into one release job;
8. creates a combined `SHA256SUMS.txt`; and
9. publishes one GitHub Release for that tag.

The workflow refuses to overwrite an existing GitHub Release.

The same workflow can be run manually for an **existing** unified tag by using `workflow_dispatch` and supplying that tag. Manual dispatch does not invent or move tags.

## Android signing gate

Android uses two deliberately separate signing identities. See [`android/SIGNING.md`](android/SIGNING.md) for the complete setup.

- Public GitHub APKs use the **muKsMaTT app-signing key** from the protected `android-release` environment.
- Play AAB uploads use the separate **muKsMaTT upload key** from the protected `android-play` environment.
- Repository Actions variables `ANDROID_APP_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256` and `ANDROID_UPLOAD_CERT_SHA256` pin the public certificates.
- Run **Android signing self-test** successfully before tagging any release that is expected to include Android.
- The two certificate fingerprints must be different.
- The unified release workflow passes `MATTRIP_REQUIRE_SIGNING=true` and verifies the final APK certificate. It must never fall back to an unsigned or debug-signed production APK.
- The Play workflow verifies the final AAB against the pinned upload certificate.

The original MattRip 1.5.0 was published in the upstream project; muKsMaTT has no numbered release yet. Configure dedicated muKsMaTT Android signing identities before its first published APK, and never reuse an upstream tag.

## Android / ChromeOS versionCode

The unified workflow derives a monotonically ordered Android versionCode from the product version:

- alpha builds sort before beta builds;
- beta builds sort before release candidates;
- release candidates sort before the stable release;
- the next patch/minor/major version sorts after the previous stable release.

Android/ChromeOS purchases remain disabled until production device validation, signing, and purchase-verification readiness are complete. The separate Play bundle workflow is distribution tooling; it does not create GitHub Releases.

muKsMaTT uses the separate application ID `io.github.maas3n.muksmatt`, so it is a different Android app from MattMux and is not an in-place upgrade path for MattMux APKs. Establish and preserve muKsMaTT's own release-signing identity before the first public APK, and verify its certificate before publishing.

## Historical releases

The repository was forked from the MattRip beta-build-6-1 baseline, which originated from MattMux 1.4.19. Any inherited MattMux tags, platform-specific tags, and old release-line history are pre-fork provenance, not muKsMaTT releases. Leave them immutable and do not reuse them for muKsMaTT. New muKsMaTT releases use only new, unused unified tags.

## Emergency fixes

If a published unified release is defective, leave its tag and assets unchanged, fix the problem on `main`, and publish the next unused muKsMaTT product version. Never rebuild an old release in place.
